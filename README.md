# Creig
Creig is a fusion of ‘creator’ and ‘gig’. The concept of our project revolves around professionalism and convenience. Creig is an event-driven application that is committed to providing a seamless experience for freelancers by being just a few taps away from them securing the job they are looking for while also endeavoring to be a one-stop solution for businesses where they can gain workers that align with their company’s protocols. Being a full web solution featuring diverse modules, Creig serves as a vital link between freelancers and companies meeting the needs of both ends, making it a top choice of users globally. With a multitude of job opportunities available on their hands, users can choose between positions of various aspects based on their qualifications and the nature of the work they are interested in. Creig, through its inventive perception, promotes the need to expand the reach of SDG introduced by the UN to address various global challenges by incorporating SDG-5,8,9, and 10. This is important because as an e-platform, Creig holds the power to inspire its users and other digital networks to foster the SDG initiatives and be a part of making this planet a better place for tomorrow. All that being said, Creig is a resourceful interface with the intent to provide its users with unmatched efficiency, connectivity, and empowerment in navigating the evolving landscape of modern work.
